TPSLVM

Matlab Code for TPSLVM: A Dimensionality Reduction Algorithm Based On Thin Plate Splines

My code is based on old version of Neil Lawrence's GPLVM code(http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/N.Lawrence/fgplvm/) and C. K. I. Williams's multiple-class GP classification code(http://www.dai.ed.ac.uk/homes/ckiw/code/gpclass.tar.gz) . For the consideration of compatibility, I have used and kept their codes in my project. Thanks.
